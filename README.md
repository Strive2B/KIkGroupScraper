# KikGroupScraper
A simple bot for scraping user data from Kik groups that uses PostgreSQL with Tomer8007's Kik Bot API. Just add the bot to groups and db will update, keep in mind users with PMs off give AJID not JID. (Haven't figured out how to resolve those yet ðŸ¤”)

Update .env file with BOT_EMAIL, BOT_PASSWORD, DATABASE_URL, PGDATABASE, PGHOST, PGPORT, PGUSER, and PGPASSWORD, also be sure to install kik-unofficial and psycopg2.
